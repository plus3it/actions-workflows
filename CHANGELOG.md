### [1.6.0](https://github.com/plus3it/actions-workflows/releases/tag/1.6.0)

**Released**: 2024.06.04

**Summary**:

*   Updates salt workflow for EL8 to use the Alma Linux 8 container. CentOS
    Stream 8 was discontinued as of June 1, 2024. Along with this
    discontinuation, the CentOS maintainers removed the CentOS Stream 8 yum
    repositories. Lack of repository-access breaks the ability to adequately
    customize the CI container, causing job failures. Explored image-options
    from Red Hat and both the Rocky and Alma projects. Found that the Red Hat
    images' repositories lacked critical RPMs. Found that the Official
    containers from Alma Linux seem to be getting updated with greater
    frequency than those from Rocky, so opted to switch to Alma.
*   Adds initial hooks for a salt workflow for EL9. Chose containers from the
    Alma project as a hedge against premature-discontinuation of the CentOS
    repos and because the Red Hat 9 container-images similarly lack critical
    RPMs.

**Released**: 2024.02.21

**Summary**:

    to v3 instead of v4 to support EL7 containers. Also updates dependabot config
    to ignore future action/checkout releases.
